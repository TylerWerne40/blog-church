      This blog was created by <a href="http://github.com/TylerWerne40/">Tyler Werne</a> for use by the NM Orthodox of the <a href="https://www.denver.goarch.org/">Metropolis of Denver</a> and    
      the Orthodox of NM, as allowed by the governing body. Tyler created this as a project for the <a href="https://boot.dev">Boot.dev</a> hackathon, but had been planning on doing this. 
      This is a gift to others.
